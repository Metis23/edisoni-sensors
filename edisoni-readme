This document describes a general method of electronic sensing, recording, and viewing data using the following components:

1. Sensors
2. Intel Edison microcomputer
3. Local wireless network
4. Server: files, web, database
5. Workstation computer 
6. Software

Task: Flash Edison and Connect to Wireless Network (per Intel)

Task: Writing Data to and from Edison

Inconveniently, Edison's kernel does not support samba shares. Instead of samba, the ssh file system function (sshfs) is used to mount directories from Edison onto other computers:

Install sshfs on the workstation and server:
	apt-get install sshfs
Keys are generated in the workstation and the server and then shared with the Edison (root@192.168.1.20 in this example) using the ssh key copying function: 
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub root@192.168.1.20
Note that ssh-copy-id is not available from Edison.
In general sshfs is used to mount some or all of the Edison's file system onto the directory tree(s) of the workstation and server in this way: 
	sshfs <edison's@ip_address:path> ,<server or workstation local path>
In our case, from workstation and server: 
	sshfs root@192.168.1.20:/home/root/ edroot -o reconnect -C -o  workaround=all
This mounts Edison's /home/root at local ~/edroot.   The “-o reconnect” option directs sshfs to reconnect if the connection to the Edison is lost.  Terminal windows accessing the mounted directories freeze when the Edison is powered off (recovery possible with: fusermount -u edroot or kill <ssh PID(s)>).   The  ssh configuration files were changed by adding the following to /etc/ssh/ssh_config:

	ServerAliveInterval 15
	ServerAliveCountMax 3

Add the line to /etc/fstab to establish connection on boot. 



Task: Store and Process Incoming Data
