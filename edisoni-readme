This document describes a general method of electronic sensing, recording, 
and viewing data using the following components:

1. Sensors
2. Intel Edison microcomputer
3. Local wireless network
4. Server: files, web, database
5. Workstation computer 
6. Software

Task: Flash Edison and Connect to Wireless Network (per Intel)

Task: Read Sensor Data with Edison

      Photocell: Photocell provides analog input.  The sensor is installed 
      with a resistor (min 10K Ohm) in series. Using the mraa library with 
      python, the sensor voltage is accessed with: "photocell = mraa.Aio(0)" 
      for analog I/O 0.  Average of 5 readings spaced at 0.2 seconds was 
      used for one measurement.
      Temperature:
      Relative humidity:
      Distance sensor (UT):
      Accelerometer/vibration sensor combo: Determine if edison sample rate 
      is fast enough to generate useful waveforms from these sensors.  will
      RRDtool be useful for this data?
      
Task: Store and Process Incoming Data

     Use RRD-tool to store database: Install rrdpython libraries, and include 
     their location in the Path.  RRD database is created with datasource, step,
     and AVERAGE specifications.  The databse is updated by a script that is 
     called by a cron job every 5 minutes.
     Translate RRD file: Edison-generated RRD file is not compatible with 
     64 bit server architecture.  Use "rrdtool dump photocell.rrd photocell.xml" 
     to generate transferable xml file.  
     SCP the xml file from the Edison to the server - excute scp on the server
     because the edison cannot generate ssh keys, but can receive them from 
     server.
     Restore the database on the server using 
     "rrdool restore photocell.xml ~/photocell.rrd 
     Use RRD-cgi to make charts in real time when called from web page.
